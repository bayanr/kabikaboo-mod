#Kabikaboo Mod

This package is simply a version of Kabikaboo that I provide fixes for. It no longer seems to be maintained, so I'm simply providing this as a maintained alternative for those who still use it.

####Make sure you uninstall any versions of kabikaboo before you install this version.

To install it on Ubuntu, simply open a terminal and paste this command in.

``` git clone https://github.com/bayanr/kabikaboo-mod && cd kabikaboo-mod && sudo apt-get install python-gtksourceview2 && sudo make install ```

If there is another distro you would like to install it for please submit a
bug report and I will add it in.
